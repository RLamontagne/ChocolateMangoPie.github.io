  <h1>Persian Saffron: The Thread That Changed Empires</h1>
  <p>
    Harvested from the <em>Crocus sativus</em>, Persian saffron begins its journey in the dry, wind-swept fields of Khorasan, Iran, where the earth is poor, but the flavor is rich beyond measure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each bloom lives for only a few fleeting dawns. And each flower offers just three red stigmas, the living threads of saffron. To produce a single pound, over <strong>75,000 flowers</strong> must be picked by hand, their filaments gently plucked by farmers who have passed down the ritual for over <strong>3,000 years</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Saffron is dried over low charcoal flames, its threads sorted by hue, curl, and scent like sacred scripts. Too fast, and the flavor vanishes. Too slow, and the story spoils.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the most expensive spice in the world, not for its cost, but for its <strong>care</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Who Has Used It</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Darius the Great soaked royal linens in saffron before battle</li>
    <li>Alexander the Great bathed in it to heal his wounds</li>
    <li>Zoroastrian priests burned it in temples to carry prayers into smoke</li>
    <li>Mughal emperors laced it into biryanis before love feasts</li>
    <li>Roman nobility scattered it during weddings to perfume the air</li>
    <li>And across Al-Andalus, it flavored the rise of poetry, rice, and revolt</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>
    True Persian saffron is prized not just for its:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Deep amber-gold color</li>
    <li>Soft earth-meets-honey aroma</li>
    <li>Delicate floral bitterness</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    …but for what it whispers:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    A little is enough.<br />
    The rarest things never shout.
  </blockquote>
  <p>
    It is the spice of <strong>restraint</strong>, of <strong>invitation</strong>, of <strong>depth hidden inside warmth</strong>.
